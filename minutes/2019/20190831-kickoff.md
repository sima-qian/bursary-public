# Charity kickoff meeting 31/8/2019 - minutes

**Attending:** Eve Ousby, Alex Rubner (Rubie), Charmaine Wright, Rob Francis, Martin Gaston

**Chair:** Eve

**Minutes:** Rubie

### Vote on organisational roles

- Eve agreed as chair unanimously
- Rubie agreed as treasurer unanimously

### Discussion: who should the charity help?

**Eve** - people who genuinely wouldn’t be able to do the course - no family assistance, no decent job that they could do, circumstances of birth not ideal

[Review of [responses](https://github.com/sima-qian/bursary/blob/master/EoI_responses/20190501-20190829_raw.md) to assistance question on FAC application form]

General agreement that while some are reasonable, many are really really really REALLY not.

***Action:** we need to hammer out exactly what the question(s) we want on the form will be and what demographics we need FAC to collect for us to have the picture we need.*

Discussion of using free school meals - good indicator, but not necessarily a guaranteed indicator of whether they need help currently.

Suggestion:

- have you ever earned more than £XXXXk - upper earnings limit
- Free school meals

### Discussion: When should we be choosing recipients of the bursary?

**Eve** - FAC decides whom to give an offer, then we decide 

  - FAC goes through its normal proces; if anyone is appropriate for us - at the point of offer - then FAC passes their details to us, then we tell them who, if anyone, we pick
  - Personal statements are submitted only by those being interviewed
  - We ask FAC to prioritise order of offers to make our lives easier and give us more time to evaluate their applications
  - FAC needs to update its processes to make clear that this bursary is available

***Action:** discuss exactly what goes on the application form*

### Discussion: set an upper earnings limit for receipients of the bursary

Agreement: set an indicative upper limit for past earnings but not make it impossible for anyone who exceeds it to be accepted

### Discussion: how best to communicate our criteria

Group settles on presenting what a good / bad candidate might look like. None of the points are dealbreakers. The model should also act as a filter, discouraging people from making unrealistic applications.

A good candidate might look like:

- Lower earnings
- Free school meals
- No degree
- Single parent / guardian / carer
- Refugee
- People who’ve come out of the care system
- Ex-offenders (non-sexual, non-violent)

A bad candidate might look like:

- High earnings in the past 5 years
- Good degree / advanced degree
- Private school

(Emphasis on the people who couldn’t do it otherwise)

***Action:** pre-application cover sheet, asking questions like “can you find somewhere to stay, is there anything you can do to make ends meet” - as a further way of discouraging inappropriate*

***Action:** Along with personal statement, request applicants submit a CV - jobs, schools, degree*

***Action:** Trustees commit to reviewing the objects at the end of the pilot period*

***Action:** trustees to send their thoughts on charity names*

***Action:** add everyone to github repo - gov doc and minutes available transparently. General agreement that we should be as transparent as we can without breaching people’s privacy.*
