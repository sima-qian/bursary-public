# Points of Proposal Passed at FAC AGM on 11th May 2019

### A bursary scheme to support students not otherwise able to attend the course

- The charity that administers the bursary will be a [**Charitable Trust**](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/charity-types-how-to-choose-a-structure?step-by-step-nav=3dd66b86-ce29-4f31-bfa2-a5a18b877f11#charities-without-a-corporate-structure-which-type-to-choose).
- The charity that administers the bursary will have the [**charitable purpose**](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-write-charitable-purposes?step-by-step-nav=3dd66b86-ce29-4f31-bfa2-a5a18b877f11) of:
  - "_For the public benefit, the advancement of education in information technology through the provision of bursaries to students of Founders and Coders C.I.C.'s London bootcamp programme who come from an economically-disadvantaged background and, without such financial assistance, would not be able to attend the bootcamp._"
- The charity will aim to have **five trustees**, and will have a minimum of three trustees.
- The charity's trustees will be **alumni volunteers** who are [not employed by Founders and Coders C.I.C.](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/london-programme/issues/919#issuecomment-482104239)
- The bursary will be [**given freely**](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/london-programme/issues/919#issuecomment-482201567) with no agreement or expectation that the student will repay any of the money.
- Founders and Coders staff will work with this charity to **identify suitable candidates** for this bursary within the FAC18* applicant pool.
- Founders and Coders staff will **share anonymised data** with this charity on the responses to the following questions from the Expression of Interest form for FAC18*:
    1. _Would you be unable to commit to the 18-week full-time programme for financial reasons?_
    2. _If you answered yes above, please give details on how much financial support you would need._
- Founders and Coders staff will **add question(s) to the FAC18\* application form** allowing candidates to apply for this bursary.
- Founders and Coders staff will **publicise** this charity within the alumni network, for example through the monthly newsletter, and **encourage donations** to this bursary fund.
- The pilot scheme will be **limited in scope** to two cohorts.

_* The first cohort to benefit from the bursary scheme will likely be FAC19 or FAC20, rather than FAC18 as originally envisioned._
